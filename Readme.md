# Git Bounty UPDATED



## A Solana platform for creating and claiming github issue bounties

### About

The inspiration for this project was to create better incentives for developers to contribute to open source projects.

On our platform you link your github and then can link issues by assigning them to a smart contract that is fully collateralized with the bounty amount.
Then developers can come and fork the repository and submit a pull request to the assgined branch for the bounty
Using github webhooks, when the pull request is merged, the developer gets paid the bounty amount

### Running Locally

#### Contract
The contract is deployed to devnet at: https://explorer.solana.com/address/HzAWxmoXNewwrJRwUY39Xjnoh25hAiQBnPgcfKYGbmxi?cluster=devnet

#### Frontend

NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
```
3. run `pnpm install`
4. run `pnpm dev`

#### Backend
1. create a `.env` under the `SolBounty` folder
